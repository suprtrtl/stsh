# stsh

stsh is a shell for Linux (Unix-like compatibility unknown) made so that I could learn how to program in Zig.

Possibilities for what stsh could stand for: 

- (s)upr (t)rtls (sh)ell
- (st)upid (sh)ell
- (st)arter (sh)ell
- (sss-z)ig buil(t) (sh)ell

Currently as seen in the code we are going with stupid shell because it doesn't do much

Written on the latest dev branch of Zig so patching will probably be required as they edit the `std.Io`

## Roadmap

Idk why this project needs a roadmap but here we are

- [ ] Aliases
- [ ] Shell scripts (reading and executing files written in stsh)
- [ ] `source` command
- [ ] Various other builtins
- [ ] Piping (yikes)
